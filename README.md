# Health Club Management System

The Health Club Management System you have created is a web-based application using JSP (Java Server Pages) that allows users to reserve and book classes at the health club.

The system allows users to create an account and log in to view the available classes and their schedules. They can browse and filter classes by type, time, instructor, and location. Once they find a suitable class, they can reserve a spot and receive confirmation of their booking.

The system also includes an administrative portal that allows club staff to manage class schedules, add new classes, and view user bookings. They can also generate reports on class attendance and revenue generated by classes.

Overall, the Health Club Management System streamlines the process of reserving and booking classes, making it more efficient for both users and staff, while also providing valuable insights into the performance of the club's offerings.
